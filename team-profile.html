							<h3>Adam Baker: s3851571</h3>
							<p>
								My name is Adam Baker! I was born and raised in Geelong, Victoria. 
								My academic achievements are an equivelent of Year 10 completed through TAFE and I'm currently studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT. 
								My favorite hobby is self teaching myself to program games and experiment applications in C# using software such as Unity Engine and Visual Studio!
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<center>
								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								I have had an interest in IT since I was i believe to be 6 years old, My mum and dad showed me our first computer and i was immediately transfixed by it. 
								I played a game on an ABC website and didn't want to stop! ever since then i had a laid back approach to it, 
								i used it for social reasons and gaming but never really decided to pursue knowledge on an academic level, however in my early teens i started to become curious about how to make my OWN programs.
								So i experimented, for the last 8 years i have been doing that on and off and only recently decided 
								it was time to take my knowledge to the next level by studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT.

							<h3>Allan Bassett: s3855474</h3>
							<p>
								Allan, Born 21st of February 1995, grew up in Melbourne's Eastern Suburbs where he attended primary school known for it's focus on German language and culture. 
								His highschool career was rocked by illness, moving onto studying at Distance Education before finishing his VCE certificate at a local highschool. 
								In his younger days Allan was very interested in soccer, playing for his local team as captain for several years before his interests changed. 
								For the last three years Allan has been working at a local Martial Arts school as their program manager, keeping everything up and working, and keeping students happy and in their classes.
								<br>
								<br>
								<center>
								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								My interest and experiences in IT started when I was young, with my father showing me simple programming in Visual Basic he learned for his job at a pneumatics factory in the late 90s. 
								He showed me how to make simple visual interfaces to make text change and start to develop little games from big books that captivated me at the time. I took off from there in my explorations of IT, 
								learning several different programming languages, at the time to make video games, and eventually working at websites and physical hardware as well. This all stemmed from those late nights with my father, 
								expanding my interest both at that time and moving on into the future of this complex and fascinating world of IT.

							<h3>Deon McGruddy: s3858512</h3>
							<p>
								My name is Deon McGruddy and I live in Melbourne, Australia. I am 23 years old and I grew up in rural Victoria in a place called Wodonga.
								My grandparents were Irish and Scottish.I can speak English, novice Japanese and novice Hindi.
								My favourite things to do are reading and playing video games in my spare time.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<center>
								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								IT is less of an interest for me and more a way of life. I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young around the age of 6 when my father and my older brothers upgraded 
								from their old computer to one that ran Windows XP. Countless hours were spent on it and that trend continues until today with me piecing togther my own at 16.

							<h3>Kylie Mayne: s3824213</h3>
							<p>
								I am a single mother of 2 pre-teen children, one of which is autistic, I have come to study late in life in my mid 30’s to begin pursuing an education 
								I can use to further my careers prospects once my children are a little older.
								I only completed grade 10 in my high school days, and have been a stay at home mother for 12 years so I have found this something of challenge.
								I live in North Queensland and have in fact, never even left the state. I love to play video games and you can find me reading (usually a fantasy series) at least once a day.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<center>
								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								My interest in IT started at a very young age, my Grandfather began working with computers and teaching himself everything he wanted to know in the early 90’s. 
								We were quite close and so I was often with him as he built a computer, or fixed them, or just experimented for his own learning. We had all the gaming systems growing up, 
								starting with the Atari and the family often spent weekends out in our garage playing the latest games together. As I got older I began purchasing my own equipment and teaching myself 
								how to build computers and fix problems, both software and hardware. My current PC was purchased nearly 14 years ago and has died and been repaired many times by myself, it’s still going strong. 
								I am fascinated with the concept of game design and coding and really enjoy reading the rise of small companies making amazing games. If those guys can do it, then maybe I can as well.

							<h3>Tomas House: s3858839</h3>
							<p>
								My names Tomas. I’m 21 years old and I’m from a town just outside of North London. 
								I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. 
								In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. 
								I want to soon take up boxing or muay thai but just haven’t gotten around to it yet. 
								An interesting fact about me would be that I’m currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<center>
								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								As I have mentioned previously, IT has always been something I’ve enjoyed, I just never really gave it much more thought than that. 
								I have always been the family “tech guy” even though I’m pretty sure most of the things I can do are minor. Alas, 
								it has given me some encouragement to try the subject in greater detail and maybe make a career out of it. Or at least it will always be a handy tool 
								with how technology based our society is nowadays. If I could choose an area that excites me the most, I would probably have to pick learning how to code in a new language. 
								As difficult as it may be, being a rookie, I find it very interesting and especially satisfying when I finally figure out what something means after spending an 
								extraordinary amount of time trying to make it work.

							<center><h2>Team Profile</h2></center>
							<p>
Every member of our team has taken a few online tests so that we can learn about ourselves and optimise our team functionality. A personality test, a learning test, and a test of the team members choice have been completed and we used the information gathered to help determine the best way our team could operate. <br> <br>
We all started by sourcing the 16 Personalities Myers-Briggs Test. The test tells us about our personality in 4 areas just like the Myers-Briggs Test, however It has the addition of one more factor called ‘Identity’. This factor underpins all the other scales by determining how confident we are in our decisions. <br> <br>
16 Personalities Myers-Briggs Test <br> <br>

Adam’s Results:
With the 16Personalities.com analysis Adam was described as an "Architect" which has the acronym INTJ. The Architect personality type is one that only makes up 2% of the population. Architects are proud of the knowledge that they gain and like to share It with others. They believe that anything is possible with enough effort and thought. When Adam reflects on his results, he can conclude that it does describe him well. Bearing this in mind, he realises that he must concentrate a little more on working as part of a team rather than taking on the project on his own. Adam understands that his positive traits will also surface in a team-based role and that the work will speak for itself. <br> <br>

Allan’s Results:
From Allan’s testing, a low extraversion score is shown over all his tests, meaning he is less likely to put himself into social situations. He is also more likely to sway towards situations that are familiar to him rather than trying new experiences.
People with this ISTP personality type are natural makers, enjoying moving from project to project and building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it. They also regularly learn from their environment as they go.  <br> <br>
While Allan finds the potential insights from these different tests interesting, he does find himself skeptical of their ability to predict his behaviours in professional settings and when working in teams.
The breakdown for Allan’s test results are as follows: <br> <br>
Area	Result
Introversion vs. Extroversion	Highly Introverted - 82%

Observant vs. Intuitive	Moderately Observant - 56%

Thinking vs. Feelings	Moderately 'Thinking' - 57%

Judging vs Prospecting	Moderately 'Prospecting' - 60%

Assertive vs Turbulent	Highly 'Turbulent' - 83%

<br> <br>
Deon’s Results:
The results of this test show that he is best suited as an advocate diplomat. This has the character code of INFJ-T. He is there to lubricate the gears for a team so that everything keeps running smoothly. However, Deon realises that he should take care to put effort into the work that he does and not just to helping others. This personality type leads to a person who is a problem solver. They try to help others in need and usually want to eradicate the route of the problem while they are at it. <br> <br>
Kylie’s Results:
The results of Kylie’s Myers-Briggs personality test are INTP. This is a logician character. The basic aspects of this personality type are of a person who is quite logical, does not use emotions as a basis for understanding or making decisions and is quite often a loner. Their minds can often easily spot patterns and problems. <br> <br>
Tomas’ Results:
According to this test, Tomas is an INFP-T mediator. This means he is very idealistic, yet flexible and open-minded. It also means that he is creative, and that he can combine his creativity and open-minded nature to be a very level-headed individual. The study says that Tomas has a hard-working and dedicated nature when challenges pop up that would deter most. However, the test also mentions some of the negative characteristics of such a person. For example, they can be impractical. Also being too idealistic can set them up for disappointment and therefore their morale can deteriorate. Tomas agrees with aspects of the test results but not all of them (which is expected). He believes that he is a hard worker and that he can also think too simply sometimes as we are not in an ideal world. However, Tomas is against the motion that he cannot see the bigger picture. Contrary to that, he thinks that he often only gets through situations by seeing the end goal. <br> <br>
Overall, Tomas would say that the test is moderately accurate and so he must take it into consideration for teamwork. He should look for personalities that harmonise with his own yet would add substance for a good team. As a person who is idealistic, Tomas needs someone who can be realistic to bring his ideas back down to Earth. Also, as a rather dominant character he would need to be in a team without too many like-minded people or the project could get dragged in too many directions. <br> <br>
Conclusion
We can draw ideas from the data we have received to create a harmonious and effective team. As in any team, we require certain characteristics for a well-rounded unit. Some of these properties can include having a team leader who takes control and organise. We need some people who like to show their creative flare, and others who like to plod on through to just get the work done. We can set up our team in a way that utilises our strengths and minimises our weaknesses. If we look at the data, we can see that Adam, being an architect, has great assets for leading a team and guiding others. Meanwhile Allan could be a valuable team mechanic. He can start sections, setting up the groundwork and then move onto another goal. Through Kylie’s logical thinking and Deon’s eye for problem fixing we could capitalise early on issues that may arise. This could allow us to quickly move past obstacles so that progress is not hindered. Tomas, on the other hand, could help navigate through dilemma’s by listening to two viewpoints and trying to negotiate an effective middle ground. <br> <br>

Learning Test
Adam, Deon, and Tomas are predominantly visual learners, while Allan is a kinesthetic learner. Kylie is also a visual learner, but she, like Allan, learns through a kinesthetic approach as well. Visual learners use material that is right in front of them to help them understand something. They can appreciate graphical data and information in a textbook or on a whiteboard. It is a very traditional approach to gaining knowledge but for some of our team, this is the best way that they retain information. They can often enjoy drawing something out to use as a study tool that they can refer to. Demonstrations can be very important for visual learners as well as other visual representations of instruction. <br> <br>
We also have two people in our group who learn through physical activities and ‘doing’ things. These characteristics of a kinesthetic learner can be aided by a hands-on approach. Sometimes ‘acting out’ or simulating ideas can help with retainment and learning. <br> <br>
We also have people who will learn somethings through auditory mediums. Deon and Tomas have this as a way that they can affectively learn. <br> <br>
Conclusion:
Having varied ways of learning throughout the team can be of great benefit as we can easily look at problems from all angles. If information is portrayed in a certain manner, we can be sure that someone will be able to understand due to our variety of learning preferences. However, due to us all learning in different ways, we must make sure that everyone is comfortable with the new information as there is no guarantee that everyone will understand. <br> <br>

Test of Choice <br> <br>

Adam’s Situational Reasoning Test:
For Adam’s third test he thought to do something a little outside of the box. He completed a "Situational Reasoning Test" which covers situational awareness and evaluation of alternatives. It was a total of 24 questions which gave him a workplace situation and multiple choices from which Adam would choose the correct decision. After Adam finished, he was scored a total of 19/24 answers correct, which made Adam acknowledge that he may have to pay a little more attention and assess a situation completely before making a judgement. The score of 19/24 still makes him a good influence on the team and gives him a high probability of reacting the best way possible to most situations. <br> <br>

Allan’s Big 5 Personality Test:
Allan’s third test shows similar results to his Myers-Briggs test results. He is edging on the side of caution, scoring “low extraversion” and “highly neurotic”. He also received similar scores on characteristics to do with his open-minded nature. <br> <br>
Deon’s Big 5 Personality Test:
Deon’s third test was also a personality test. This indicates that he is high in agreeableness and openness. While interacting with people, Deon is likely to be swayed by new ideas or opinions. When working on a project he should make sure to stick with what is feasible and stick within constraints. The results for Deon are similar to what he scored in his Myer-Briggs Test. He is an open-minded team player. <br> <br>
Kylie’s Big 5 Personality Test:
Kylie does not agree with some of her results. She disagrees with the idea that she is an angry or self-conscious person. The test has given Kylie high scores for both, as well as scoring her highly in some respects that she specifically picked as less applicable to herself. It has also given her quite high scores in intelligence, creativity, morality, and cooperation. <br> <br>
Tomas’ Creativity Test:
Tomas’ final test was a creativity test. The following test describes him as having a complex and abstract mind. This means that Tomas can produce abnormal concepts from ideas or information. The complex side of the test means that he can handle large quantities of information at once and be able to manipulate and manage the information well. It also claims that Tomas lacks the ability to make connections. This means unless something has an original apparent connection, he may struggle to link the two concepts together. <br> <br>
Tomas is not sure how much he agrees with this test. Normally, he would say that he is able to hand and manipulate information, but he is not convinced that he is not able to see new connections between ideas. Tomas would say that this is one of his strengths. The inaccuracy of the test could be purely down to the limited number of questions as creativity is such a complicated characteristic. Tomas also says that he probably would not use this test to identify good potential fits for team members whom he can work with. He wants to take a few more creativity tests to see what type of creativity he should be looking for in a team. <br> <br>

Conclusion:
Adam could use his newfound knowledge about his decision-making skills to influence his team in the correct way. He knows that he can trust his instincts and that he will be right most of the time. However, for the most part, these final tests wouldn’t allow our team to develop any decisions on how to work in a team as 3 out of the 5 tests gave our team members similar information to what they already had, and Tomas didn’t agree with the information he learned in his creativity test.

							<center><h2>Ideal Jobs</h2></center>
							<p>
							Each member of 6Teen has a good and solid idea of where they might like to take their future IT career paths. Deon, Kylie, Tomas, and Adam were all focused specifically on coding and programming positions. All of which require many more years of experience and training, as well as previous experience in similar positions in the case of Adam, Kylie and Deon’s chosen positions. <br> <br>
Allan was our outlier in his ideal position of Helpdesk or IT Support. Allan’s chosen career path involves a lot of customer service skills as well as an in-depth knowledge of the software (in this particular case, Windows) or the ability to find solutions and workarounds for his clients. Being a customer service oriented position his technical knowledge, while important, would not be enough without the ability to communicate well with clients, supervisors, and any personel working under him. <br> <br>
Similarly, Adam’s chosen position as a software developer also requires experience in customer service as well as the required coding knowledge in java and .Net. His chosen position also requires prior experience in a similar organisation as well as the ability to multitask and work on several projects at once. <br> <br>
Deon’s chosen position was a software engineer for VR and hardware. This position requires an extensive knowledge base and years of experience. Although not all jobs require this, having more experience will lead to a greater chance of obtaining such a role. Deon’s chosen role will require experience in game design, as well as specifically working with VR technology, interactions between humans and computers, and the use of software specific to the industry such as the game engines Unity and Unreal. <br> <br>
Kylie’s chosen position of mobile game developer also focuses on game development and the use of the Unity engine alongside learning other specific skills such as animation, coding in C#, and working specifically with 3D technologies, whether that was in games or other technologies. Her chosen position also requires previous experience developing a game that was successfully launched in the app or play store. <br> <br>
Tomas chose a junior developer’s position as his ideal position. This position requires the skills to develop, test, and maintain software. His chosen position also requires knowledge of several coding languages including C#, CSS and, Javascript.  Customer service skills and good communication are also listed as required for such a role, as it is for many in the industry. <br> <br>
On the surface all of us except Allan have very similar goals and career paths in mind; however once we look deeper there is a lot of overlap in each of our positions and some large differences as well. Allan, Adam and Tomas all chose careers where customer service skills were a must. Both Deon and Kylie have chosen positions that require previous game development and experience in the same game engines. Despite the shared experience, the actual positions require knowledge of different platforms and hardware.  <br> <br>
Offering similarities. <br> <br>
IT Support was a small subtheme of our group’s goals in learning IT, with Tomas and Allan requiring these soft skills as a prominent part of their job. Programming skills were more across the board of us all, in some cases the chosen position requiring upward of 4 different languages required from their chosen position. Allan’s ideal position remains out largest outlier, requiring learning the technical specifics of one program or system and all its functionalities. Each of our ideal career positions require previous experience working in similar companies and in some cases proving commercial success with those companies. <br> <br>
Despite each position being some aspect of IT and four of the five being in very similar sounding careers it is very clear that each of these positions are far away from each other in terms of our chosen career routes. While there is a lot of overlap between the positions each of them are unique and the differences are quite large. It will be very interesting to see the directions they may end up taking us in the long term.
